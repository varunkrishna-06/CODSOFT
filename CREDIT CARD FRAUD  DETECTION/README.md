## 7. Conclusion

The Logistic Regression model, enhanced with SMOTE to address class imbalance, effectively detected fraudulent transactions, achieving a high ROC AUC score and balancing precision with recall. Analysis of feature importance revealed that transaction amount and certain categorical features were critical in predicting fraud. The use of SMOTE successfully balanced the class distribution, essential for preventing model bias. This model significantly improves fraud detection, reducing financial losses and enhancing transaction security. Key feature insights can guide refinement of detection strategies. Future work should explore other models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, incorporate additional features such as transaction frequency, and fine-tune hyperparameters with techniques like Grid Search. Testing the model on live data will provide practical insights, and continuous monitoring will be crucial to adapt to new fraud patterns. 
Overall, the project laid a strong foundation for developing robust fraud detection systems, offering valuable insights that can drive further enhancements in financial fraud detection.
